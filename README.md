# Pacman-PathPlanning
Comparison of tree search based and RL-based approaches for Pacman environment

In this project we use the Pac-Man environment developed in Berkeley University. For more information please visit [source page](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)

Requirenments:
  * Python 2.7

To check the environment, run command below from ```pacman_multiagent/``` directory: 
<pre>
python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -l originalClassic
</pre>

We have to implement two classes ```MonteCarloTreeSearchAgent``` and ```ReinforcementLearningAgent``` from ```pacman_multiagent/multiAgents.py``` file
